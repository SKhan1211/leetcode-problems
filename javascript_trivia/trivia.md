What is the significance, and what are the benefits, of including 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript source file?

My Answer: Honestly, that is not something I am sure about. I do remember using it especially when I was
doing the pre-ES6 style Javascript importing/exporting modules, but I haven't had my own personal use case for it as of late.

Correct Answer: The short and most important answer here is that use strict is a way to voluntarily enforce stricter parsing and error handling on your JavaScript code at runtime. Code errors that would otherwise have been ignored or would have failed silently will now generate errors or throw exceptions. In general, it is a good practice. Makes debugging easier, prevents accidental globals, eliminates this coercion, disallows duplicate parameter values, makes eval() safer, and throws error on invalid usage of delete.
